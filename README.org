[[https://melpa.org/#/defrepeater][file:https://melpa.org/packages/defrepeater-badge.svg]]

This package lets you easily define "repeating commands," which are commands that can be repeated by pressing the last key of the sequence bound to it.

For example, let's say that you use ~winner-mode~, and you have ~C-c C-w p~ bound to =winner-undo=.  Obviously, pressing that whole sequence repeatedly is tiresome when you want to go several steps back.  But using this macro, you can press ~C-c C-w p~ once, and then keep pressing ~p~ to repeat =winner-undo=, until you press a different key (you could press ~C-g~ if you needed to stop the repetition so you could press ~p~ normally).

** Usage

First, define repeating commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  ;; Automatically defines `winner-redo-repeat' command:
  (defrepeater #'winner-redo)

  ;; Optionally specify the name of the repeater, like using `defalias':
  (defrepeater 'winner-undo-repeat #'winner-undo)
#+END_SRC

Then bind keys to the new commands (example using [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general]]):

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (general-def
    [remap winner-redo] #'winner-redo-repeat
    [remap winner-undo] #'winner-undo-repeat)
#+END_SRC

For example, @@html:<kbd>@@M-SPC w p@@html:</kbd>@@ was bound to =winner-undo=, so now @@html:<kbd>@@M-SPC w p p p@@html:</kbd>@@ can be pressed to call =winner-undo= 3 times.

=defrepeater= can also be used directly in a key-binding expression:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x o") (defrepeater #'other-window))
#+END_SRC
